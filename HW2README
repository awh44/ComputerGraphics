Assignment 2 - Catmull-Rom Splines

The program provided here takes in two tangent vectors and a list of control points provided by a file
and outputs, to standard out in OpenInventor format, the control points and a polyline for the 
Catmull-Rom spline defined by those control points.

The program was written in C on Ubuntu Linux and compiled using gcc. The exact commands to do the
compilation can be seen in the Makefile. To simply compile using the Makefile, type "make", which will
create the CG_hw2 executable. The individual modules can be compiled individually as well, with
different targets in the Makefile producing different object files in the bin/ directory. To clean up
the directory, type "make clean". This will remove the executable, the files in bin/, and any files in
output/ as well.

Note that the main function is located within src/hw2_main.c.

The options are as follows. Note that none of them are required.
	-f filename
	The name of the input file with the tangents and control points; default value "cpts_in.txt". The
	input file must have the format
		t1x t1y t1z
		tNx tNy tNz
		x1 y1 z1
		x2 y2 z2
		...
		xN yN zN
	where each line has three floating point numbers seperated by spaces, with the last number being
	immediately followed by a newline (including the last line in the file). The first two lines define,
	respectively, the tangent at the first point and the tangent at the last point, and the remaining
	lines define the control points.

	-u increment
	The increment to be used in evaluating the points on the polyline; default value 0.09. Must be
	in the range (0, 1].

	-r radius
	The size of the radius to be used when drawing the control points of the Bezier curve; default value
    0.1.
