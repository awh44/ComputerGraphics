CS 536
Assignment 5 - Hierarchical Models

The program provided here takes in a variety of command line parameters and outputs, to standard
out in OpenInventor format, a series of cuboids representing a "robot arm" and two spheres, one
exactly at each end of the arm.

The program was written in C on Ubuntu Linux and compiled using gcc. The exact commands to do the
compilation can be seen in the Makefile. To simply compile using the Makefile, type "make", which
will create the CG_hw5 executable. The individual modules can be compiled individually as well,
with different targets in the Makefile producing different object files in the bin/ directory. To
clean up the directory, type "make clean". This will remove the executable and the files in bin/.
To automatically generate the files given as examples on the assignment page, type
"make outputs/sellipsoidN_type.iv", where "N" is the example number, 0-4, and "type" is either
"flat" or "smooth."

Note that the main function is located within src/hw5_main.c.

The options are as follows. Note that none of them are required.
	-t theta1
	The rotation of the robot's first arm around the world's z-axis. Default value -51°.

	-u theta2
	The rotation of the robot's second arm around its own y-axis. Default value 39°.
	
	-v theta3
	The rotation of the robot's third arm around its own y-axis. Default value 65°.
	
	-l length1
	The length of the robot's first arm. Default value 4.

	-m length2
	The length of the robot's second arm. Default value 3.

	-n length3
	The length of the robot's third arm. Default value 2.5.
